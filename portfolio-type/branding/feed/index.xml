					<description><![CDATA[Super thin, super light and super strong—American Optical&#8217;s Force 55 Progressive Lenses needed a logo that looked as high-tech as their new super position design.  The thin typeface stands tall within the surrounding negative space to achieve the desired look. The magazine ad promoted the power of this break-through lens likening it to the geologic forces that build mountains. I created new packaging, displays and other print collateral for this new brand.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Visions line of library furniture by Moduform is their most unique design yet. It features a black top trim above solid maple end panels. The Moon Plate and sleek curves stood out and I referenced these shapes in the logo design. The brochure features a die cut in the shape of the end panel with the optional hook for hanging your jacket or backpack. The speckled appearance of the desk veneer was used as the background for the view brochure, postcards, and posters.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tim needed a new identity and portfolio folder to showcase his work and purpose. He wanted to convey an image of strength, integrity and vision. The Irish Wolfhound embodies these characteristics and ties nicely to his Irish heritage. As a master finish carpenter specializing in ornate, intricate trim, Tim’s clients tend to be well-to-do and have refined tastes. The design balances the richness of embossed gold foil and a spot varnish with the course texture of a common craft paper.]]></description>

The Irish Wolfhound embodies these characteristics and ties nicely to his Irish heritage. As a master finish carpenter specializing in ornate, intricate trim, Tim’s clients tend to be well-to-do and have refined tastes. The design balances the richness of embossed gold foil and a spot varnish with the course texture of a common craft paper.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[After a year of updating their existing sites, Sawhorse was ready for a change. I created a new identity to reflect both their modern and traditional work. The logo is an abstract of a knot and grain in a piece of wood. The san-serif font Neue Helvetica was chosen for its neutral form and clarity. I developed a Content Management System in WordPress, wrote custom plugins for back-end management,  built a content aware request plugin for delivering appropriately sized images to smart phones and tablets, and designed a fluid layout for various screens now referred to as Responsive Web Design.]]></description>
